# Introduction #
 > Elixir is Erlang, but without the ugly syntax

For years we've all known that concurrency was important. We probably started trying to use Erlang, but it was so unfriendly we turned away. Then we tried Scala, but it was a bit too much like Java to feel comfortable.

# Getting Started #

I'm not going to patronise you.

Just `brew install elixir`!
